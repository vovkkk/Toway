# Toway
This is probably one of the weirdest apps out there — aggregation of certain tasks from file(s) in plain-text format.  
It have been created with [PlainTasks](https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks#plaintasks) in mind.

Basically, the idea is to get a destruction-free list which answer the question _what I gotta do today?_

## Requirements
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7
* [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
* [PlainTasks](https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks#installation)


## Usage
Currently Toway is in supposedly-active development so it might be not really convenient or/and useful for wide audience of small group of ~~nerds~~ people use PlainTasks;  
it supports  

* monitoring many files at once (drag&drop to add them into app)
* only one tag at once (`@today`)

and that’s it.


## Сontributions
Contributions are welcomed — pull requests, ideas, questions, _anything_ — just open a new issue.  
I have a rough [plan](Toway.todolist.txt) for future features.
