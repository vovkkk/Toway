# Toway
Aggregation of certain tasks from file(s) in plain-text format — reduce noize to see only important stuff, and quickly open file at corresponding line in Sublime Text to see context or edit; list updates automatically as soon as you save file.

It has been created with [PlainTasks](https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks#plaintasks) in mind; all kinds of bullets are supported including [TaskPaper](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper) style.

## Requirements
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7
* [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
* [PlainTasks](https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks#installation)


## Usage
Currently Toway is in supposedly-active development so it might be not really convenient or/and useful for wide audience of small group of ~~nerds~~ people use PlainTasks;  
it supports  

* monitoring many files at once (drag&drop to add them into app)
* look for many tags (list of tags is hardcode in script, you can modify it)

and that’s it.


## Сontributions
Contributions are welcomed — pull requests, ideas, questions, _anything_ — just open a new issue.  
I have a rough [plan](Toway.todolist.txt) for future features.
