Settings:
  ☐ call an update on change if need

Tasks:
  ☐ improve update so only necessary items would be updated @important
      currently it re-creates the entire list
  ☐ sorting

Tags:
  ☐ add/remove tags @today
      need to add settings window
  ☐ filtering
      drop-down list with check-boxes to hide/show items with certain tag(s)
  ☐ notifications for @due(date)

Filelist:
  ☐ drag&drop while file_list is visible shows both lists @bug
  ☐ ability to remove file
  ☐ update amounts of tasks
  ☐ add check-boxes to disable watching a file w/o remove it from settings file
      some way to check/uncheck all, uncheck all except one (or something)
      thus files become dict instead of list
          {'path1': true, 'path2': false}

Misc:
  ☐ errors reports
      set red icon with number on filelist button and show errors inline in appropriate item(s)
      e.g. some file doesn’t exist any-more or couldn’t be read because permissions
      it also could suggest some actions, e.g. click button to remove file from settings or open parent folder in Explorer
  ☐ ¿search/filter task&file lists?
  ☐ help should explain unclear moments + about
  ☐ helpful ¿and maybe funny? place-holders for empty lists
  ☐ ¿cache tasks so if file(s) remain unchanged app won’t read them again on start-up?
  ☐ better UI, e.g. colourful tags on each item or different backgrounds, overlay scroll bars
  ☐ create tasks within the app, some sort of ‘Inbox’
  ☐ edit w/o switching to ST, this is probably hardest to do
  ☐ ¿ moto: «[organize|control|navigate|review] your plain-text to-dos in sensible way» ?

  ✔ calc&set correct sizeHint @project(Tasks)
    height==40px is *bad* due to diff./custom font-sizes on diff. OSs
    weight==-1   is *okay* to avoid horizontal scrollbar
  ✔ show tags on second line instead of line number @project(Tasks)
  ✔ take many tags at once @project(Tags)
  ✔ all pending bullets @project(Tasks)
  ✔ put source file path in item’s tool-tip @bug @project(Tasks)
    done, but tooltip doesn’t follow cursor if items have same tooltip value
    unique tooltip for each item hides the issue somewhat, thus consider it is fixed
  ✔ open file on click @project(Filelist)
  ✔ one more list to display files are being watched @project(Filelist)
    main concern is how to do it: tabs? tool box? tool buttons?
    buttons seems easier to customise
    besides, there will be button for settings, so all elements would be buttons
