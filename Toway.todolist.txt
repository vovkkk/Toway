Settings:
  ☐ call an update on change if need

Tasks:
  ☐ improve update so only necessary items would be updated
      currently it re-creates the entire list
  ☐ put source file path in item’s tool-tip @bug
      done, but tooltip doesn’t follow cursor if items have same tooltip value
  ☐ consider to hide line numbers at some point?
  ☐ all pending bullets
  ☐ sorting
  ☐ calc&set correct sizeHint
      height==40px is *bad* due to diff./custom font-sizes on diff. OSs
      weight==-1   is *okay* to avoid horizontal scrollbar

Tags:
  ☐ support many tags
      need to add settings window
      show stripped tags in tool-tip
  ☐ filtering
      drop-down list with check-boxes to hide/show items with certain tag(s)
  ☐ notifications for @due(date)

Filelist: @high-priority
  one more list to display files are being watched
  main concern is how to do it: tabs? tool box? tool buttons?
  buttons seems easier to customise
  besides, there will be button for settings, so all elements would be buttons
  ☐ add check-boxes to disable watching a file w/o remove it from settings file
      some way to check/uncheck all, uncheck all except one (or something)
      thus files become dict instead of list
          {'path1': true, 'path2': false}
  ☐ obv. open file on click

Misc:
  ☐ errors reports
      im thinking about Firefox console
      in case of errors window (status-bar?) get some red icon with number
      so user may ignore it or click it to see a new window with list of errors
      e.g. some file doesn’t exist any-more or couldn’t be read because permissions
      it also could suggest some actions, e.g. click button to remove file from settings or open parent folder in Explorer
  ☐ ¿search/filter task&file lists?
  ☐ help should explain unclear moments + about
  ☐ helpful ¿and maybe funny? place-holders for empty lists
  ☐ ¿cache tasks so if file(s) remain unchanged app won’t read them again on start-up?
  ☐ better UI, e.g. colourful tags on each item or different backgrounds
  ☐ create tasks within the app, some sort of ‘Inbox’
  ☐ edit w/o switching to ST, this is probably hardest to do
